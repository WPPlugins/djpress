A simple WordPress plugin for displaying Mixes.

== Description ==

This Plugin is currently in it's early stages. 
Many updates planned.

= Future Plans =

*This list includes a list of changes that are planned for a future release*

1. Creation of a hosted webservice to generate waveforms so that we can display the waveform prior to the song being played.  *currently we cannot do this because the waveform processing crashes the web-browser if the song is longer than 5 minutes long* **Full Hi-Def waveform generation will be offered to those who purchase a future "Pro" version of this plugin, while the free version will include only a basic waveform outline**
1. A new "Appearance" panel where you can change the color of the different sections of the waveform
1. A new "Options" panel which will allow you to disable/enable certain plugin functions ( Tracklist, Download, Play, etc... )
1. Addition of timestamps for the tracklist, which would place markers on the waveform
1. Creation of full description with screenshots, logo, etc.
1. Addition of album cover image
1. Addition of math logic to make the waveform width fit the screen
1. The same as above, but on resize.
1. creation of default styling. *currently the plugin is designed to be completely styled by the end user* **Pro version will include several themes - Dark, Light, perhaps even a custom one where you choose the colors with some colorpickers**

== Screenshots ==
